What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge and a rebase are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch into another in Git. A merge creates a new merge 
commit that combines changes from both branches. A rebase rewrites the commit history of the branch being rebased 
by moving its changes on top of the target branch.

What is a remote repository?

 Remote repositories facilitate tasks like code sharing, version tracking, and team collaboration, 
 as developers can push their changes to the remote repository for others to access and merge.
